# 🎬 Box Office Revenue Prediction App

This project is a **machine learning-powered Streamlit web app** that predicts the **box office revenue** of a movie based on its metadata (budget, release date, genre, language, country, director, actors, etc.).

The model uses **XGBoost** trained on the **TMDB 5000 Movies Dataset** and integrates feature engineering techniques such as frequency encoding, target encoding, and log transformations.
